Updated runs on more recent hera data (H4C and H5C).

plotScripts contains some very basic scripts for plotting calibrated visibilities and the fits images that come out of FHD.

runScripts contains all of the scripts needed to flag the data with SSINS, apply the flags, phase the data, make uvfits files, and run FHD. See the README file within that directory for information on how to use the scripts.

Each additional directory contains raw data, ssins flags, flagged and phased uvfits files, and FHD outputs.
